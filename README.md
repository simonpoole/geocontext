## List of "interesting" per country/territory properties

The territory names are hierarchical as in __country__ or __country__-__territory__ to allow overriding higher level values (for example in the US Virgin Islands there is left hand traffic, so that requires an entry for us-vi). Note the lower level entries do not inherit properties from higher level ones.

Properties:

  __"distance"__ unit system for distance and speed __"metric"__ (default) or __"imperial"__

  __"left-hand-traffic"__ side of the road that is driven on, __false__ (default) or __true__

  __"speed-limits"__ array of common speed limits in the territory, if __"distance"__ is "imperial", the units are assumed to be miles per hour, otherwise km per hour
